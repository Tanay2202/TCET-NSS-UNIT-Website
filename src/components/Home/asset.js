    testament: `JAI HIND ! Just to be clear this is my First Ever Feedback in the journey of NSS, and I am glad to be giving the feedback as a Council. 😌 As we all know we are the so called CORONA BATCH, but our particular Unit from NSS too, is the CORONA UNIT as our seniors too got more offline exposure and our juniors will also surely get all upcoming projects in online mode. (Humse ki kuch khaas lagav tha ishwar ko ). Ab kya hi kar sakte hain yeh sochke poora man lagake projects complete kiye, council ki daant khaaye aur dekhte hi dekhte TCET ka sabse bada aur pyaar ek NSS PARIVAAR ban gaya . Council ne 3 cheezen sikhayi thi - 3 Principles of NSS, DISCIPLINE, PUNTUALITY & RESPECT and following all these principles will eventually make all the volunteers unite which is true. Talking about SE ka journey, I feared and respected our Councils a lot and did all my projects with utmost sincerity because (Council ka daant na khaana pade 😂 ), humare TE sabse best the, who always motivated us and helped us throughout the projects (Jaldi karo Council dekhenge toh chillaienge). Looking at these motivated seniors and also our batchmates bonding very well was one of the best parts jo bahot yaad aaienge. I will always be greatfull to have got the wonderfull oppurtunity of serving as the NSS COUNCIL in my TE, after 3 Stages of Interview (which is the most in any body of TCET ), and after becoming the COUNCIL the way people, especially NSS Volunteers will look at you totally changes. (NSS COUNCIL main hai bhai watt toh hai kaafi izzat hai inki). Apart from this the main motivation was our SE, (SE ke baccho pe sabse zyada dhyaan dena hai NSS ka future wahi honge, unko acche se sab kuch sikhana hai #legacy must go on) from recruiting them to teaching them basic values and legacies of NSS, ek ek kaam ke peeche sabne bahot mehnat aur efforts liye hain. TCET main rehke NSS Recruitment nahi experience kiya toh kya TCETian banoge tum , ekdum Roadiess Feelzz. Major Events jaise Republic Day, Vaccination Drive, Blood Donation Camp, Old Age Home Visit, Awareness in Singh Estate jo NSS ka main chehra aur focus rehte hain woh humne apne UNIT pe ekdum acche sur sabhya tareeke se complete kiya, iss samay samajh aa gaya ki yeh volunteers masti ke saath saath kaam bhi ekdum acche se karte hain, NSS Volunteers ke Discipline aur Puntuality ke charche poore TCET main hain . Having made so many memories and given so much efforts for this unit, it is really painful that this all is finally coming to an end. (As told by our Councils "Yeh ek saal kaise nikal jaiega na pata bhi nahi chalega ek ek moment enjoy karo aur poori mehnat se kaam karo") Will always remember each and every volunteer of our unit, SE aur TE dono ne bahot daant bhi khaayi hai, gusse wala look bhi dekha hai aur saath diya hai poora saal 😂. This journey was really filled with many ups and downs but the ones who always were by my side were my Council Mates "Khushi, Mayank, Om, Chhayank, Praveer, Priyanshu & Vaishnavi". You guys made it seem like a cakewalk for us, people will never know how hectic and complicated it was the way we handled it. As said in NSS "Once a Volunteer, always a Volunteer", we will always be a helping hand for our unit and am excited to see our juniors carry the legacy of NSS throughout their journey. JAI HIND !`,

      "Jai Hind! “Maine socha na tha, yeh kaisa silsila, NSS ne diya pyaar ka rang, dosti ka sailaab, Har pal yaadgar, har lamha adhura na sahar, Ek anokha yaado ka khazana, ek naya manzar.” Toh kahani shuru hoti hai 2nd year me jab mujhe phele se hi nss me aana tha but kabhi socha nahi tha itna involve aur addicted hojauga isse, nss kya karta hai yeh phele se hi pata tha but actual me kya hai aur kaisa hai yeh 2 saal me jaana sikha aur samja, “Don’t judge a book by its cover” suits best for nss bahar se kitna bhi strict ya boring lagge but andar se vitna hi mazzedaar aur pyara hai but khair sabki bas ki baat nahi isse samajne ki!!😂 From not knowing the fullform of NSS in the recruitment to leading the NSS as a Council ufff kya hi rollercoaster journey thi🫶, Unfortunate bolo ya lucky bolo I had missed the first round of recruitment since I was out of town, but jab me vapas aaya me apne friends se pucha kya hua and all, bahut backoff karne lag gaye kya hai yeh sab hum toh nahi jaarahe and mujhe advice dene lag gaye “mat jaa bhaii baadme bolna mat warn nahi kiya”, I was like aisa kya hi hosakta and kardia ki itna khuaff aur halchal🤔 Ab aage kya hua voh toh mystery rahegi….”What happens in NSS Stays in NSS”🤫…..lets jump in to my first project, jab hamara phela project hua fitness activity sab khuaff me dare hua hai and jab hamare councils aaye toh kuch bole halaki simple instruction derahe but uss time laga kidhar aake fas gaye, jo bhi hassa toh fassa wala scene tha but Dheere Dheere iski aadat hogyi aur projects me fun & bonding kaise karne hoti sikh gaye phir toh jitni memories yaad karo vitni kam. One of the best times and memories of the NSS journey is NSS camp( Ek do Ek do….)and sojourn dance 100 log bina dhanka Mukki aur coordination ke sath naache sirf 1 week ke practice me aisa sirf NSS hi kar sakta, batane ko toh bahut kuch hai but sabdho me sab jaya nahi hopayega!! Vakt ka pata hi nahi chala aur SE ka tenure khatam aur TE me entry, council ki daat sunte sunte and unko follow karte karte hame realise hi nahi hua ki ab hamari baari aa gayi hai Council banne ki, Interview phase ki screening kisi placement round se kam nahi thi phele Hamara TE leta tha phir Councils and unse bach gaye toh Program Officers( jitna aasan lagta tha tha nahi but iska bhi ek alag mazza aur experience tha jo ajj jab me yeh likh raha toh samaj me aarha) Yeh sab ho jaane ke baad kon bana kon nahi yeh pata lagane keliye toh sabne jee jaan aur apne calculation lagane shuru kardi, Finally hume unit photo wale din traditionals carry karne bola(sirf unko jo councils bane hai and kisiko batana nahi tha), sabko ek dusre pe shak horha tha, halaki me kisiko itna jaanta nahi tha phir bhi soch raha tha kon hosakta😂 Phir jab bulaya gaya 7 anjaan chehre jinhe dekha toh hai but kaise hai bilkul idea nahi, sabki personality alag kuch councils se jyada close kuch mere jaise anjaan, uss moment laga inke sath pura saal kaise kaam hoga yeh karege bhi ya nahi but with time sabke sath bonding hoti gayi and vakt ke sath sab acha hota gaya. Councils banne ke baad bahut kaand hue hai but jabhi hum 8tho sath hote chize sambhal jaati thi. Kabhi socha nahi tha council ki jitni value rahti utna hi load rahta, maine jitni raat jagke kaam kiya vitna ajj tak kabhi nahi kiya rahuga, jab bana toh ek alag se responsibility aayi and ussi din thaan liya tha jo karuga ache se hi karuga and I can proudly say ki hum 8tho ne legitt kuch kiya hai💪, From naming the group OG Councils to actually becoming the OGs🤍 was one of the memorable journey of my life. Recruitment me kitni raat baithke 500 logo me se best volunteers chunna to Camp me 30+ projects  karne ka safar itna yagdaar rahega kabhi socha nahi tha. Camp was the best thing which we can say with pride kuch ukhada hai from nahi hopaya itna to hoga and karege was a challenge which we all took,jo bhi man me tha sab kiya infact bonding session me 100 logo ko  treasure hut tak khilla diya jo kisine socha bhi na tha but in the end “RAATEIN BEET JAATI HAI YAADEIN YAAD AATI HAI!!”🥹. Bahut man tha mere tenure mein kuch chaap chodhne ka and ek nayi legacy banane ka jo yeh website launch karke horahi😎, Kudos to my dearest Ogs, Junior Councils, Creative Team and yess the Technical team for being so cooperative and supportive throughout this journey . Being a NSS volunteer was the best thing that happened to me till date in college. And sharing such an important position with these 7 best people was awesome. Chahe kuch yaad rahe ya na rahe ye 2 saal hamesha yaad rahenge and in sab ko mei kabhi nahi bhul paunga. Thank you NSS for everything, jo kuch bhi life lessons mile hai uska bahot bahot dhanyawad.✨ “Once a Volunteer, always a Volunteer”. Jai Hind!",

      "JAI HIND ! I tended to gravitate towards solitary activities, preferring to spend my time alone watching movies, learning something new, or simply sitting quietly with my thoughts. Social situations made me uncomfortable, and I often felt like I didn't belong. That's when I decided to step out of my comfort zone and join NSS.Without a question, the best aspect of my experience was the recruitment procedure. I was able get exposure while engaging in a variety of activities by joining NSS, in addition to giving me a chance to give back to society. During the projects, I found myself engaging in teamwork and collaboration, something I had always shied away from. Working with fellow volunteers on community projects became a catalyst for personal growth. I discovered the joy of contributing to something larger than myself. The experience of organizing and Participating in a range of activities, including cleanliness drives, visits to old age homes, blood donations, and The Sojourn Dance, within the NSS has afforded me diverse settings and opportunities. These experiences have contributed to the development of my ability to effectively balance my commitment to serving others with the pursuit of personal fulfillment and enjoyment. One of the most surprising aspects was the support and camaraderie I found among my fellow volunteers. The shared goal of making a positive impact brought us together, and I realized that I wasn't alone in my journey.Being part of NSS has been one of the most significant experiences in my life. I believe everyone should consider dedicating a small portion of their lives to helping others. In doing so, you lose nothing but gain a unique and fulfilling kind of happiness. JAI HIND ! ",

NSS is without a doubt our college's most formidable body, as evidenced by our effort and zeal, but don't mistake this strength for a lack of enjoyment. My time as a volunteer has been the most fun I've had in years. From debate competitions to Old age home visits, from blood donations to The ELECTRIC Sojourn Dance, NSS has given me a variety of settings and opportunities to strengthen my ability to balance my need to serve others with my need to have a good time. It is here that I have witnessed my efforts make a significant difference in the lives of the needy, as well as where I have witnessed perfect strangers become best friends. Aise hi nahi hum khudko family ka title dete hai, when I needed it, I had a stronghold of 200 volunteers on my side, which is what every college student hopes for.
