                      Having led the unit for years, I've gained valuable
                      experiences and witnessed students' growth project by
                      project. When thinking of NSS, core values like
                      discipline, punctuality, and respect resonate. Discipline
                      is crucial for societal uplift, punctuality defines NSS
                      volunteers, and compassion towards society and nature is
                      imperative. Congratulations to every TCET NSS UNIT
                      volunteer for their selfless dedication, contributing to
                      society's betterment and fostering continuous learning and
                      growth.
